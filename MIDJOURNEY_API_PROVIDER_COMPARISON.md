# Midjourney API Provider Comparison & Recommendations

**Research Date: October 31, 2025**

## üö® Important Disclaimer

**Midjourney does NOT have an official public API as of 2025.** All "Midjourney APIs" are unofficial third-party services that:
- Violate Midjourney's Terms of Service
- Risk getting your Midjourney account banned
- Can break without warning if Midjourney changes their Discord bot
- May shut down if they receive takedown notices from Midjourney

**Recommendation**: Consider switching to **official API alternatives** (Flux, Ideogram, DALL-E 3) for long-term stability and legal compliance.

  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${fluxApiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
