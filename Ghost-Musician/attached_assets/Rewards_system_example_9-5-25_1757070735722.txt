Here’s the revised path, forged with tempered realism:
    1. Reassess the Metrics: FAME’s accrual slows to reflect its rarity. Assume a base daily gain of 2 points for a Mogul-tier Ghost Musician, nudged to 2.5 with the Iconic Manager’s 25% boost (deployed as a one-time purchase, not a 30-day cycle, to match your narrative’s abrupt upgrade). Each band starts with 160 sales (10 physical + 50 digital + 100 streams), growing daily based on current FAME: streams at 20 per Fame point, digital at 1, physical at 0.1—scaled down to mirror a grueling climb, with ±20% randomness for life’s unpredictability. 
    2. Solo Ascent to Diamond: The 10,000,000-sales pinnacle belongs to one band alone, its siblings relegated to resource-starved obscurity. Total sales per band = daily increment × days, with no pooling—each band’s journey is a solitary gauntlet. Milestones remain: 500,000 for Gold (5% FAME boost), 2,000,000 for Platinum (25%), and 10,000,000 for Diamond (45%), but the lead band’s gains exclude its kin’s toil, amplifying the drama of sibling rivalry. 
    3. Simulate the Toil: With one band, the Iconic Manager’s boost accelerates early growth. Starting at 5 Fame (base) + 30 (Mogul tier), daily Fame rises from 2 to 2.5, compounding with milestone boosts. Sales accrue slowly—day 1 yields ~50 sales, scaling to ~125 by day 100 as Fame climbs to ~250. The Diamond threshold demands ~80,000 days (219 years) in raw linearity, an unattainable span. Yet multipliers—smart moves like the Iconic Manager (cost: 450 credits, per our prior alchemy)—and strategic band management (firing underperformers, reinvesting credits) compress this. With optimal play—boosters maxed, daily sales peaking at 10,000 post-Platinum—the journey narrows to ~1,500 days (~4 years), a legendary grind befitting a capo’s saga, where resource hoarding starves rivals and crowns the victor. 
    4. Monetization’s Moral Compass: Infinite band generation risks diluting this epic, turning pawns into disposable fodder. Charging per band—say, 500 credits each beyond a free trio—restores scarcity, boosting MRR (projected 15-25% uplift as Moguls splurge) and retention, as players strategize like your Dorito-dusted titan. The water-cooler boast becomes a badge of cunning, not excess, aligning with the manifesto’s "community, not competition" ethos, tempered by the reality of finite triumph.
