## Major Development Phases

### Phase 1: Platform Vision & User Progression System

**Assistant Response:** I understand my work so far, so let's begin our conversation.

**User:** "AI allows people the opportunity to do so much more with their lives, than once was imagined. The resources and efficiency of retail AI is evening out the playing field of in many areas, and the music industry is not immune to this phenomenon. This "game" introduces the user to a real section of entertainment, where going viral can make you the next Taylor. Please use these last few interactions to generate a robust mission and vision statement for the virtual artist environment that we are creating. I also need a pragmatic list of legal concerns, and liabilities, and procedures to keep our company protected. The company is called AetherWave LLC, and I have already registered it with the Colorado SOS last week. The other features that will provide real value to the user, will be Simplified portals to contract with distributors, and help with mastering, marketing and navigating the new AI assisted music industry. AetherWave Studio will be synonymous with this new type of service.

## Final Phase: Royalty-Free Music Marketplace Vision

**User Final Request:** "Yes, lots of important direction tonight. And it brings up another app that I will want to begin development on today. Here's the big - general - idea. I want an interface that mimics the familiarity and use of a Spotify or Prime music playlist. Playlists will be populated with Aetherwave Royalty free music, often divided by genre playlist. I envision theme packs week have their own playlist. The interface has unobtrusive download links that will be active for paid subscribers, a free tier will always allow for free streaming. This will allow an ease of use that will invite traffic, as well as submissions for consignment or or full licensing sales from a growing army of human vetted contractors. They will make themselves available o us, thanks to the professional playlist inspired marketplace and unique experience of the platform, brand community, and virtual artist progression that makes us feel like a vested partner in the quest for relevance and fame in the newly accessible music industry."
